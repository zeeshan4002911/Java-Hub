/**
 * Merge two sorted linked list

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
Input Format

The format for each test case is as follows:

The first line contains an integer n, the length of the first linked list.
The next line contain n integers, the elements of the linked list.
The next line contains an integer m , the length of the second linked list.
The next lines contain m integers, the elements of the second linked list.
Output Format

Output a single line of (n + m) integers consisting all elements of linked lists in sorted order.
Example 1

Input

3
1 2 4

1 3 4

Output

1 1 2 3 4 4

Explanation

3
1 3 4

Output

1 1 3 4 5 9

Explanation

Merge the two linked list in sorted order
Constraints

The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].

-100 <= Node.val <= 100

Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
